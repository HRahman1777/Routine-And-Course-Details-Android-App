    <string name="about"> # This app do work both offline and online. Just for first time you need to use over internet.

\n# When routine or course teachers information has changed then if you run this over internet, it will update automatically.(For Make sure, you
        can press Refresh for each UI)

        \n#You can copy text from CourseInformation so that it will be easy to get GOOGLE CLASSROOM CODE for you.

\n# To update its information it takes MAXIMUM 8-15kb (less 2-5kb), so try to use over internet (when new routine or information comes).

\n\n# YOU DONT NEED TO UNINSTALL IT, EVERY SEMESTER IT WILL UPDATE AUTOMATICALLY. (Just run it over internet to get updates)

\n\n\n\t\tI am not so good on designing, so plz ignore it. I just tried to make it and I think it will be helpful for my class-mates (PC-B 49th-CSE Batch).
\n\n\n\nTHANK YOU FOR INSTALLING IT :)
